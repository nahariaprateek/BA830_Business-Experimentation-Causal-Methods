Studying the Impact of Virtual Reality on Sports: An Experimental Study
A rapidly developing technology, virtual reality (VR) has become more and more common in a variety of industries, including entertainment, education, and healthcare. Researchers have recently begun investigating VR's potential for improving athletic ability. Darts, a game that demands a high degree of accuracy and precision, is one such activity that has caught the interest of researchers. We wanted to find out how VR affected the accuracy of dart throwing, so we conducted this research to find that out. We were particularly interested in determining whether a more immersive and realistic training setting could help a person throw darts more accurately. To accomplish this, we carried out an experimental study in which participants completed a series of dart-throwing tasks after being randomly assigned to either a VR or non-VR group. We hope that this study will add to the increasing body of knowledge on the potential of VR in sports performance development. Our results may be useful to athletes, coaches, and trainers who are searching for cutting-edge approaches to enhance performance in a variety of sports, including archery.

Research Question
Does practicing throwing darts in a virtual reality setting cause an increase in performance (score) of throwing darts in real life?

Hypothesis
Practicing throwing darts in a virtual reality setting before throwing it in real increases performance. Participants who practice throwing darts in virtual reality will perform better in subsequent real-world dart-throwing tests than participants who do not receive virtual reality-based training.
